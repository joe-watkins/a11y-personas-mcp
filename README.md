# Accessibility Personas MCP

A simple MCP server that provides accessibility personas for different use cases. 

## Important note about synthetic users with disabilities

**These synthetic personas are educational tools and starting points for accessibility considerationsâ€”they do not replace the need to work directly with real people with disabilities.** Each person's experience with disability is unique, and these generalized personas may not accurately reflect the full spectrum of real-world impacts, adaptive strategies, or individual preferences. For meaningful accessibility improvements, always prioritize user research, usability testing, and direct feedback from people with disabilities in your target audience.

## Installation in VS Code

1. Open VS Code Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
2. Search for "MCP install" and select it

What accessibility considerations should I keep in mind for users with motor impairments?
```

```
How should customer care handle interactions with deafblind users?
```

```
What are the main barriers for users with low vision when using customer support?
```

```
Review this support process for accessibility issues:

"Our standard support process requires customers to: 1) Call our phone line, 2) Navigate to our website while on the call, 3) Click through multiple menus to find their account settings, 4) Read confirmation codes aloud, and 5) Confirm changes verbally before hanging up."

Script type: phone
Issue category: account-access
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Problematic Support Script
```
Review this customer support script for accessibility issues:

"Hi there! I can see you're having trouble with your account. Let me help you fix this quickly. First, look at your screen and find the bright green 'Settings' button in the top-right corner. Click it now. Good! Now I need you to tell me what you see on the page so I can confirm you're in the right place. If you don't see the options within 5 seconds, try refreshing your browser with F5."

Script type: phone
Issue category: technical-support
```

**Expected Issues:**
- Visual dependencies ("look at your screen", "see")
- Color dependencies ("bright green button")  
- Speech requirements ("tell me what you see")
- Time pressure ("within 5 seconds")
- Technical jargon ("F5")
- Spatial directions ("top-right corner")

### Example 2: Better Support Script
```
Review this improved support script:

"Hello! I'm here to help you access your account settings. There are several ways we can do this together. I can send you a direct link via email or text message, or I can guide you through the navigation step-by-step at whatever pace works for you. Which option would you prefer? Once you're ready, I can provide confirmation through your preferred communication method."

Script type: phone  
Issue category: account-access
```

**Expected Result:** Much higher accessibility grade with inclusive alternatives.
