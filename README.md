# Accessibility Personas MCP (Model Context Protocol Server)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for AI and LLM-powered accessibility analysis, automation, and inclusive design evaluation. This project provides 60+ structured accessibility personas and tools for use by AI agents, Copilot, and other LLM-based systems. Whether you want to review designs, test code or content against personas, ask accessibility consulting questions, review customer support scripts, or integrate inclusive practices into your workflow, this server enables AI-driven accessibility insights and recommendations.

## Important note about synthetic users with disabilities

**These synthetic personas are educational tools and starting points for accessibility considerationsâ€”they do not replace the need to work directly with real people with disabilities.** Each person's experience with disability is unique, and these generalized personas may not accurately reflect the full spectrum of real-world impacts, adaptive strategies, or individual preferences. For meaningful accessibility improvements, always prioritize user research, usability testing, and direct feedback from people with disabilities in your target audience.

## Installation in VS Code / Github Copilot
1. Clone this project
2. Open VS Code Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
3. Search for "MCP install" and select it
4. Choose "Command (stdio)" as the connection type
5. Configure the MCP server:
   - **Command**: `npm start --silent`
   - **Name**: `A11y Personas MCP`
   - **Type**: Local MCP
5. Save the configuration

*note:* The MCP server will now be available in your VS Code MCP clients list. Start the server by clicking on the gear icon and choosing "Start Server". Ensure you are in Agent mode and run the  `#list-personas` tool in Copilot to list all personas and to start working with them. The A11y Personas MCP Tools should be listed in your Copilot tools panel.
