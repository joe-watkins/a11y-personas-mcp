# Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please open an issue or pull request with your proposed changes. For major changes, discuss them with the maintainers first.

1. Ensure that there is not already an issue or pull request for your change.
2. Double check that the Persona is not already defined in `personas/`.
3. *Template* Ensure the /data/_template.md file is used for new personas.
4. Create only a single Persona per Pull Request.
5. Ensure the #analyze-persona-patterns tool is run to update pattern associations after adding new personas.

Thank you for helping improve accessibility for all!
