# Build Army - 10 more
Disability is very nuanced. Create [xx] more personas with different varations of real disabilities Disability is a spectrum so no one person with a disability has the same needs. They can share similarities but be creative and realistic. Think about the best way to name the files - if the persona should belong to an obvious group then add that to the beginning of the filename e.g. temp-, deafness-, blindness-. Use the exact file structure as autistic.md that is our personas template. Use any online resources you need to come up with the content.  Do not include names or job titles - stay generic like all of our other personas. Run the analyze-personas mcp tool when done to update the data. Avoid the word "user" in the file name. Avoid duplication of personas. Each persona should be unique and add value to the personas MCP. Avoid conflicting information. Double check your contributions and always use people-first language. 

## Digital Environments
Consider disabilities that may impact a user's ability to interact with a digital experience. Think less about physical spaces and more about digital spaces like native iOS and Android apps and websites.

## List Personas
Use the personas mcp list-personas tool to get existing personas.

## Check for Duplicates:
You will cross-reference the proposed new personas against the existing files in your personas folder (such as one-handed-limb-difference.md, color-vision-deficiency.md, autistic.md, blindness-*.md, deafness-*.md, etc.).

## Remove Duplicates:
Any persona already represented in your personas folder will be removed from the new list.

## Provide a Clean, Unique List:
Iâ€™ll present a revised list of 10 new, unique personas that do not duplicate your current collection, each with a clear, descriptive file name.

## Biography and Attribution
Ensure that the new persona has a Biogarphy, Quote, and Attribution if needed.
