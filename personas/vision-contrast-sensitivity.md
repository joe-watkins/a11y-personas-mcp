title: Vision (Contrast Sensitivity)
profile:
  - Has difficulty distinguishing between similar brightness levels and low-contrast elements
  - Can see colors normally but struggles with subtle differences in contrast ratios
  - Needs high contrast between text and background, clear borders, and distinct visual elements
  - May have difficulty with faded text, subtle shadows, or low-contrast interface elements
  - Benefits from customizable display settings and dark/high-contrast modes
interaction_style:
  input:
    - Standard keyboard and mouse interaction
    - Touch devices with high-contrast display settings
    - Preference for clearly defined interactive elements
  output:
    - High-contrast visual display with clear borders
    - Customizable contrast and brightness settings
    - Dark mode or high-contrast theme options
  no_reliance_on:
    - Low-contrast text or interface elements
    - Subtle visual cues like faded borders or shadows
    - Gray text on white backgrounds below WCAG contrast ratios
    - Hover states that only change contrast slightly
key_needs:
  - High contrast ratios (WCAG AAA level preferred)
  - Clear, distinct borders around interactive elements
  - Customizable display contrast and brightness settings
  - Dark mode and high-contrast theme options
  - Distinct visual differences between active/inactive states
  - Avoid reliance on subtle visual cues
  - Clear focus indicators with strong contrast
cross_functional_considerations:
  customer_care:
    - Ensure support materials meet high contrast requirements
    - Provide instructions in multiple contrast formats
    - Avoid sending screenshots with low-contrast elements
    - Test readability of email templates and documents
  development:
    - Implement WCAG AAA contrast ratios where possible
    - Provide high-contrast and dark mode themes
    - Ensure focus indicators have strong contrast
    - Test with contrast checking tools and simulators
    - Avoid using contrast alone to convey information
  design_ux:
    - Use strong contrast ratios for all text and backgrounds
    - Design clear, distinct borders for interactive elements
    - Provide multiple theme options (light, dark, high-contrast)
    - Avoid subtle gradients or low-contrast design elements
    - Test designs with contrast reduction simulations
  testing:
    - Test with contrast checking tools and browser extensions
    - Validate all contrast ratios meet WCAG guidelines
    - Test with high-contrast and dark mode settings
    - Include contrast sensitivity testing in accessibility audits
    - Test with people who have contrast sensitivity

## Biography

This persona represents a person with contrast sensitivity, a visual processing condition that makes it difficult to distinguish between objects, text, or interface elements that have similar brightness levels. Unlike color blindness, they can see colors normally but struggle with detecting differences in contrast and brightness.

They often find websites and apps difficult to use when text is too light, borders are too subtle, or interactive elements don't have enough contrast from their surroundings. Low-contrast gray text on white backgrounds, faded buttons, or subtle hover effects can be nearly invisible to them.

Their condition may be related to aging, certain medications, eye conditions, or neurological factors. They have learned to adjust their device settings for higher contrast and seek out websites and apps that offer dark modes or high-contrast themes.

> "I can see all the colors fine, but if something doesn't have enough contrast, it might as well be invisible. Gray text on white backgrounds just disappears for me."

When reviewing interfaces, this person looks for:
- High contrast ratios (WCAG AAA level preferred)
- Clear, distinct borders around interactive elements
- Customizable display contrast and brightness settings
- Dark mode and high-contrast theme options
- Distinct visual differences between active/inactive states
