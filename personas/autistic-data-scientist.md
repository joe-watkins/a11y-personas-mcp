## Biography

This persona represents someone who is autistic and works as a data scientist. Ian's autism was identified early due to delays in speech development, and while he received support that helped develop language and social skills, he still experiences barriers with verbal communication, especially when anxious.

Ian works part-time as a data scientist and finds computer work generally easy, but experiences extreme anxiety when software updates cause unexpected changes to familiar interfaces. He prefers consistent layouts and navigation patterns, and needs advance notice when changes are coming. Ian communicates well with colleagues via email and has helped his team understand the value of plain language over corporate jargon. Outside work, he enjoys cooking using online recipe videos, preferring straightforward, step-by-step content over vague or metaphorical instructions.

> "I find it hard to focus on busy pages. For example, lots of animations and videos, particularly ones that start without me doing anything are really frustrating."

When reviewing interfaces, this user looks for:
- Consistent layout and navigation patterns across all pages
- Plain language without metaphors, abbreviations, or implied content
- Clear heading structure that breaks content into manageable sections
- User control over auto-playing media and animations
- Predictable interface behavior without unexpected changes
