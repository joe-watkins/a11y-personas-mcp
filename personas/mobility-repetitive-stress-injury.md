## Biography

This persona represents a person with repetitive stress injury (RSI) caused by prolonged computer use. They experience pain, stiffness, or numbness in their wrists, arms, or neck that worsens with extended digital device interaction, particularly with traditional keyboards and mice.

They have adapted their digital workflow to include frequent breaks, ergonomic equipment, and alternative input methods like voice recognition. Their condition requires careful management of how long and how intensively they interact with digital devices.

The severity of their symptoms can vary daily, and they benefit from interfaces that allow them to minimize repetitive motions while still accomplishing their digital tasks efficiently.

> "I need to be strategic about every click and keystroke. If an interface makes me do the same motion repeatedly or doesn't support my voice input, I simply can't use it for long."

When reviewing interfaces, this person looks for:
- Alternative input methods (voice, ergonomic devices)
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Break reminders and session time limits
- Large, well-spaced interactive elements
- Minimal repetitive motions required
