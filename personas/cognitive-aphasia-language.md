title: Cognitive (Aphasia - Language Processing)
profile:
  - Has aphasia from stroke, brain injury, or neurological condition affecting language processing
  - May have difficulty understanding written text, finding words, or expressing thoughts clearly
  - Intelligence and cognitive abilities remain intact, but language processing is impaired
  - Benefits from simple language, visual supports, and extra time for processing
  - May understand more than they can express, or express more than they can understand
interaction_style:
  input:
    - Keyboard and mouse with extra time for processing
    - Voice input may be difficult due to word-finding challenges
    - Visual and symbol-based input when available
    - Gesture or touch-based interactions preferred
  output:
    - Simple, clear language with short sentences
    - Visual icons and symbols to support text
    - Audio output may help with comprehension
    - Multiple formats (text, visual, audio) preferred
  no_reliance_on:
    - Complex sentences or technical jargon
    - Time-pressured reading or communication tasks
    - Text-only instructions without visual supports
    - Rapid speech or fast-changing content
key_needs:
  - Simple, clear language in short sentences
  - Visual supports (icons, pictures, symbols) alongside text
  - Extra time for reading and processing information
  - Consistent, predictable navigation and layout
  - Multiple ways to access the same information
  - Option to replay or repeat audio content
  - Clear headings and well-organized content structure
cross_functional_considerations:
  customer_care:
    - Use simple, clear language in all communications
    - Provide visual supports and examples alongside text
    - Allow extra time for responses and processing
    - Offer multiple communication channels (visual, written, simplified)
    - Be patient and avoid complex explanations
  development:
    - Support multiple input methods and alternative formats
    - Implement clear, consistent navigation patterns
    - Provide text-to-speech and speech-to-text options
    - Ensure content can be easily parsed by assistive technology
    - Include visual indicators and progress markers
  design_ux:
    - Use simple, familiar language throughout the interface
    - Include relevant icons and visual supports with text
    - Design clear, logical information hierarchy
    - Avoid cluttered layouts or overwhelming content
    - Provide multiple ways to access the same information
  testing:
    - Test with simplified language and plain language principles
    - Validate that visual supports enhance comprehension
    - Check that content works with text-to-speech tools
    - Test navigation consistency and predictability
    - Include people with aphasia in usability testing

## Biography

This persona represents a person with aphasia, a language disorder that affects the ability to communicate, typically resulting from stroke, brain injury, or neurological conditions. Aphasia impacts language processing - understanding, speaking, reading, and writing - while leaving other cognitive abilities largely intact.

They may understand much more than they can express (receptive aphasia is less affected) or may speak fluently but have difficulty understanding (expressive abilities are better preserved). The severity and type of aphasia varies greatly between individuals.

In digital environments, they benefit greatly from visual supports, simple language, and extra processing time. Complex interfaces with technical jargon or time-pressured tasks can be particularly challenging, while well-designed visual cues and consistent navigation help them succeed.

> "I know what I want to say and do, but the words get jumbled between my brain and my mouth. Pictures and simple words help bridge that gap."

When reviewing interfaces, this person looks for:
- Simple, clear language in short sentences
- Visual supports (icons, pictures, symbols) alongside text
- Extra time for reading and processing information
- Consistent, predictable navigation and layout
- Multiple ways to access the same information
