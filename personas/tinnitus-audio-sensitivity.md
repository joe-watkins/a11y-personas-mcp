## Biography

This persona represents a person with tinnitus, a condition characterized by constant or intermittent phantom sounds such as ringing, buzzing, or hissing in the ears. They experience audio sensitivity and need precise control over digital audio to prevent worsening their symptoms.

The constant background noise from tinnitus can make concentration difficult, so they benefit from interfaces that reduce cognitive load and provide clear visual feedback. They often prefer visual notifications over audio alerts, as additional sounds can be overwhelming or painful.

Their digital experience is significantly improved when they have granular control over audio settings, including the ability to adjust volume precisely, filter frequencies, and prevent unexpected audio from playing.

> "I need to control every sound that comes from my device. Sudden audio or sounds I can't adjust make my tinnitus worse and break my concentration completely."

When reviewing interfaces, this person looks for:
- Precise audio volume controls with fine adjustments
- Visual alternatives for all audio alerts and notifications
- No auto-playing audio content
- Frequency filtering or audio customization options
- Clear visual indicators for all system states
