## üéØ Future Considerations

### Core Infrastructure Improvements

### Enhanced Persona Features

#### `validate-design`
Validates design specifications against accessibility personas.
- **Parameters**: `design_description` (string), `personas` (array), `interaction_type` (string)
- **Returns**: Accessibility issues identified per persona with severity levels
- **Use Case**: Early design validation to catch accessibility issues before implementation

#### `generate-test-cases`
Creates specific test scenarios based on personas.
- **Parameters**: `feature_description` (string), `personas` (array), `test_type` (string)
- **Returns**: Detailed test cases with steps, expected outcomes, and tools needed
- **Use Case**: QA teams can generate comprehensive accessibility test suites

### Practical Implementation Tools

#### `accessibility-checklist`
Generates context-aware accessibility checklists.
- **Parameters**: `project_type` (string), `personas` (array), `team_role` (string)
- **Returns**: Role-specific, persona-informed accessibility checklist
- **Use Case**: Different team members get relevant guidance for their role

#### `code-review-assistant`
Analyzes code snippets for accessibility issues.
- **Parameters**: `code` (string), `framework` (string), `target_personas` (array)
- **Returns**: Specific accessibility issues with fix suggestions
- **Use Case**: Automated accessibility code review integration

### Team Collaboration Features

#### `review-care-scripts`
Reviews customer support scripts through the lens of accessibility personas.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `script_content` (string): The support script text to review
  - `script_type` (string): phone, chat, email, in-person
  - `issue_category` (string): technical-support, billing, account-access, etc.
  - `personas` (array, optional): Specific personas to focus on (default: all)
- **Returns**: 
  - Overall accessibility grade (A-F)
  - Persona-specific issues and severity levels
  - Suggested script modifications
  - Alternative interaction methods to offer
  - Inclusive language recommendations
- **Use Case**: Customer care teams can ensure their scripts are accessible and inclusive for all users

**Example Issues Detected:**
- "Ask customer for verbal confirmation" ‚Üí Flag for deaf/non-speaking personas
- "Please look at your screen" ‚Üí Flag for blind/low-vision personas  
- "Click the red button" ‚Üí Flag for colorblind users
- Time-sensitive instructions ‚Üí Flag for motor-impaired users who need more time
- Complex technical jargon ‚Üí Flag for users with cognitive differences or low tech literacy

**Example Prompt:**
```
Review this customer support script for accessibility issues:

"Hello, thank you for calling support. I need you to look at your screen and click on the red 'Account Settings' button in the top right corner. Once you see the settings page load, please tell me verbally what you see so I can confirm you're in the right place. If you don't see it within 10 seconds, refresh your browser and try again. Now, can you quickly navigate to the 'Security' tab and read me the last 4 digits of your recovery phone number?"

Script type: phone
Issue category: account-access
```

**Example Response:**
```
üî¥ ACCESSIBILITY GRADE: D- (Multiple Critical Issues)

CRITICAL ISSUES:
‚Ä¢ Deafblind Person: BLOCKED - Script assumes sight ("look at screen") and speech ("tell me verbally")
‚Ä¢ Motor-Impaired/Non-Speaking: BLOCKED - Requires verbal response, time pressure (10 seconds)
‚Ä¢ Low Vision User: HIGH RISK - Color dependency ("red button"), spatial directions ("top right")
‚Ä¢ Deaf/HoH User: MEDIUM RISK - Phone-only support, verbal confirmation required

SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. "I can help you access Account Settings. Would you prefer me to send you a direct link via email/text, or would you like me to guide you through the navigation?"

2. "There are multiple ways to verify you're in the right place - I can send a confirmation code to your email, or you can describe what you see in whatever way works for you."

3. "Take as much time as you need. I'll stay on the line while you navigate."

4. Offer alternative verification: "For security, I can verify your identity through email, text message, or by asking you some account questions instead."

INCLUSIVE ALTERNATIVES:
‚úÖ Provide multiple communication channels upfront
‚úÖ Offer email/text alternatives to phone
‚úÖ Remove time pressure and visual dependencies  
‚úÖ Use device-agnostic language ("select" vs "click")
‚úÖ Offer multiple verification methods
```

## üìù Implementation Notes

- All personas are stored as markdown files in the `personas/` directory
- Template file (`_template.md`) should be excluded from available personas
- Current personas:
  - `deaf-blind.md`
  - `low-vision-taylor.md` 
  - `motor-impaired-non-speaking.md`
  - `sighted-deaf-hoh-low-tech.md`

- ES modules require special handling for `__dirname` using `fileURLToPath`
- Cross-platform path handling is important for Windows/Unix compatibility
- Error messages should be helpful and guide users to available options
